I am working on a Number system converter, for now it will not be GUI app, and this app is coded in c++, I hope I will convert it in GUI, At this moment it is working but it will convert Decimal to Binary Numbers only, I am coding to add all conversions in it. It contains some functions which can divide large numbers, so now you can convert any number, this program does not have any limits, convert as large number as you can.
