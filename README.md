This is a C++-written number system converter; it does not currently have a graphical user interface (GUI). It is now functioning, but it simply converts decimal to any number system and vice versa, other conversions will be added soon, I am working on them. I intend to turn it to a GUI programme shortly once I will add every conversion.
I'm building code to support all conversions, and it includes various functions that divide, add, subtract, multiply huge numbers.
You can convert any decimal number; there are no restrictions with this tool. Convert as many big numbers as you can.
