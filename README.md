This is a C++-written number system converter; it does not currently have a graphical user interface (GUI). It is now functioning, but it simply converts decimal to binary values. I intend to turn it to a GUI programme shortly.
I'm building code to support all conversions, and it includes various operations that divide huge numbers.
You can convert any number; there are no restrictions with this tool. Convert as many big numbers as you can.
